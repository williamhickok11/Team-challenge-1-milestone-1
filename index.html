	<!-- Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled Create.
	When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM - similar to the quiz and group project. You decide the height/width of the card.
	Above the text on each card, there must be two input controls of type color.
	Above the text on each card, there must be a button element labeled Delete.
	When the user selects a color from the first input, then the background color of that card, and no other cards, should change to the color chosen.
	When the user selects a color from the second input, then the font color of that card, and no other cards, should change to the color chosen.-->
	
	<!-- product.replace(product[i], " ") -->
	<!--
	When the user clicks the Delete button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM. -->
